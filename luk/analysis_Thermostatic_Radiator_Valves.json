    "severity_impact": "Medium damage severity indicates that the valves are experiencing some issues, but are not yet failing completely. This reduces the lifespan and necessitates a repair sooner than the typical 20-year lifespan. The predicted repair addresses current moderate issues, and the calibration check aims to prevent further degradation. Without intervention, the valves might require full replacement much sooner. The cost reflects the need for part replacement and labor for the repair and calibration."
